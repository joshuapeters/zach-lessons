5. Lets make a project for your homework :)


## Homework
[Here is a list of fun APIs you can play with!](https://medium.com/codex/15-fun-and-interesting-apis-to-use-for-your-next-coding-project-in-2022-86a4ff3a2742) Take a look through them and play around with their examples. Just get a feel for how it feels to use an API.
Whats most important here is you understand how routes, route parameters, and query strings work. You should also understand how to make a request to an API, and know that it will return a response.

### API Project
Using the [pokemeon API](https://pokeapi.co/), make an app that renders a list of pokemon. Provide an input that a user can enter text into, and allows them to search for a specific pokemon.

You'll want to use the [fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to make a request to the pokemon api. For now, don't worry about using typescript! Normal javascript is totally fine :)

Due in TWO weeks.
