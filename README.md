# Welcome!
These are the plans and notes from our hangs. Be sure to fork this repo to refer back to anything.

These might be incomplete, so be sure to merge this into your fork often. Also, feel free to make updates or take notes in this from your branch as well! Refreshing from my fork will hopefully not interfere too much with anything you have going on in here. Git is smart :)
